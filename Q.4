Steps :
1)import the necessary libraries
2)Use the predefined model of the Puma560 robot in the Robotics Toolbox.
3)Specify the desired position and orientation for the robot's end-effector. The position is a 3D point, and the orientation is represented by the identity matrix (indicating no rotation)
4)Create the Transformation Matrix .Combine the target position and orientation into a transformation matrix. The transformation matrix consists of both position (translation) and orientation (rotation).
5)Compute the Inverse Kinematics.Set an initial guess for the joint angles, here initialized to zero.Use the ikine_LMS method to compute the joint angles that would place the end-effector at the specified position and orientation.
6)Verify if the solution obtained is valid. This involves checking if the output is not None and if all joint angle values are finite (not NaN or infinity).
